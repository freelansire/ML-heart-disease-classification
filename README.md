## ðŸ«€Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that uses machine learning to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on clinical and medical attributes. Various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries are used for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

#### Approach
We follow the steps below in the notebook:

#### Problem Definition
Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?

#### Data
The dataset used comes from the Cleavland data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
> https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease

UCI Repository: Heart Disease Dataset
Kaggle: Heart Disease Classification Dataset

#### Evaluation
We aim to achieve at least `95%` accuracy in predicting heart disease during this proof of concept.

#### Features
Here is a brief description of the key features in the dataset:

* age: Age in years
* sex: (1 = male; 0 = female)
Refer to the `data/data-dictionary` folder for complete information on the features.
